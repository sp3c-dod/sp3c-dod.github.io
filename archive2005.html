<b>&nbsp; BuLLeT Taking A Break</b><p>
<blockquote>
<i><font color="gray">Posted: Mon. April 11, 2005 10:27 p.m. EST</font></i>
<br>BuLleT has decided to take a break from DOD for awhile.  Please send all correspondence to DarKnight until he returns.  Good luck to everyone with your CAL seasons.

<b>&nbsp; Stop Talking Got Frag Ads!</b><p>
<blockquote>
<i><font color="gray">Posted: Mon. April 4, 2005 9:44 a.m. EST</font></i>
<br>Annoyed by talking ads on Got Frag?  Go to your C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\ folder (winnt if running Windows 2000) and open the file "hosts" in notepad.  After the line "127.0.0.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; localhost" hit enter TWICE and paste the following two lines:<br>
<pre>127.0.0.1 k84105.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 v841n5.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 m8154n.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 5jjkl1.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 j4185x.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 l81941.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 m8154n.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 n75915.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 k417cz.gotfrag.com
127.0.0.1 m4715n.gotfrag.com</pre>
If you notice some talking ads that this does not block simply go to "View Source" in your browser and do a serach for "displayadvertisment", you will be able to find the server that the advertisment is on that way.  I have done this for talking AIM ads as well.  Find a samples hosts file by clicking <a href="hosts">here</a>.<p>
<i>Note: If you have known extensions hiding enabled in Windows this file might get saved with .txt on the end of it.  It will NOT work with .txt on the end of it.  It must be just "host".  Also, you must close and reopen MSIE for <a href="lol_no_more_ad.gif" class="tablelink">the settings to take effect</a>.</i>

<b>&nbsp; Sp3c is dropping STA and joining TPG2</b><p>
<blockquote>
<i><font color="gray">Posted: Sun. February 20, 2005 1:20 p.m. EST</font></i>
<br>Sp3c will drop STA after this season and join TPG2.  The competition appears better in TPG2 and the website is far easier to use.  Oh yeah and BuLLeT is a TPG admin, so there is some bias there.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i><font color="gray">Posted: Sat. February 05, 2005 12:44 p.m. EST</font></i>

<blockquote>
<i><font color="gray">Posted: Sunday January 30, 2005 11:06 p.m. EST</font></i>
<br>Sp3c|aLisT has now joined STA Gold for the remainder of the Winter 2005 season.  They have joined this season late into the season, but hope to still make an impact in the playoffs.  Sp3c|aLisT has also taken over Pizza Bagels TPG 3v3 team as the majority of the people playing for this team were Sp3c members anyway.

<b>&nbsp; BuLLeT and Patio get new duties</b><p>
<blockquote>
<i><font color="gray">Posted: Mon. January 17, 2005 7:26 p.m. EST</font></i>
<br>This has been an exciting week for BuLLeT FoDDeR and Patio Furniture.  They were both hired as UC Radio DOD Casters.  They broadcasted the first ever CAL exhibition match vs. the European team TWR and the American team uKz.  Despite a delay because of broadcasting HLTV things went really well and they are both looking forward to casting in the future.  Also, BuLLeT was named a TPG 3v3 admin.  I highly recommend you join the TPG 3v3 league. <a href="http://3v3.tpgleague.org/">-Link-</a>
