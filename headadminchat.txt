[21:38] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> [Away] Reason:[Auto Away: 30mins of no action] Gone for:[1hr 13mins 45secs] Pager:[OFF] - SysReset 2.53
[22:22] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> whats up
[22:23] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> Hi, I would like an full explanation as to why my account is suspended.  I have been vacation and am unaware as to what it going on.
[22:24] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> http://www.sp3c.org/resources.html
[22:24] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> Warning: Some leagues and public servers may view the use of these files as cheating
[22:24] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> distributing cheats
[22:25] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> I would like an actual explanation please.
[22:25] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> what else would you like to know
[22:25] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> its pretty self explanitory
[22:26] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> you have cheats on your site that bypass the file checker
[22:26] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> maddox posted a link to them on trypants
[22:26] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> you both are suspended
[22:27] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> Alright the first thing I would like is for you to cite the exact rule violation you are suspending me for.  The second thing I would like is for you to define which files are cheats and why.
[22:27] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> the ambient sound files
[22:27] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> the only cutom legal content is available on the cal site
[22:28] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> What about my crosshair pack that is not on the CAL website or the HUD on my website that is no on the CAL website?  I would still like the rule violation as well please.
[22:31] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> Are you still there?
[22:34] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> yeah
[22:34] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> the crosshairs/huds are detectable through screen shots
[22:34] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> the sounds are not
[22:35] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> and the rule is considered common sense
[22:35] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> I'm sorry a search for "common sense" in your rulebook turned up no results.  Can you please elaborate?
[22:36] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> you cant have cheats that bypass a file enforcer
[22:36] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> you can claim that you didnt know or they were for pubbers, but that is what a qc is for
[22:36] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> its common sense
[22:37] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> Alright well thank you for your time.  I will contact quality control.
[22:37] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> alright
[22:44] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> May I ask you a question?  Who gets my qc request?  Is it you being the head admin or is there still separate qc admins like in the best?
[22:46] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> operations
[22:46] <Sp3c-BuLLeT> thank you
[22:46] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> np

[22:46] <CAL-dods|CMorlock`afk> retired to a different game
