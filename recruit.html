<h2>Join Team Sp3c|aLisT!</h2>
-- Cheaters, hackers, exploiters, spawn campers (actually sitting in spawn), and lamers not allowed.<br>
-- CAL does not allowed custom models or sprites. Please don't use these if you join.<br>
-- If your voice hasn't cracked yet or you can't play in CAL matches please don't ask to join.<p>

<b>The way we play (due to learning stuff while in CAL this may be changed soon):</b><br>
Our main focus is on dynamic teamwork.  We believe pre-planning too much is a bad idea.  The most
pre-planning we would ever do is "ok, I'll go bridge".  Our primary concern is capping the two+ man
flags.  We constantly relay important info such as the enemy position and your current location over
the microphones.  Based on this information every team member is expected to dynamically know what to
do and adapt.  We have no one team leader who will be directing traffic.  We believe this is absurd.  Everyone is expected to be able to hold their own weight.  We do not bark out orders and expect you not to do the same.  Anytime someone tells you to do something it is a helpful suggestion.  For example:<p>
"I'll go hill, you go bridge," means I'm planning on going hill, and I think you should go to the bridge.  Saying this out completely would be absurd and time consuming.  Responses can be:
"ok", "I'm already headed hill" (assumes the other person should go bridge).  No verbal response assumes that it is ok for the other person to go as planned.  It is assumed that you are going to the other location or have something vital to accomplish and can't get on the mic.<p>
It is unacceptable to get smart with other clan members or be disrespectful.  Never be negative.  "Nice Try" is acceptable.  "You suck" is not.  "Sorry" is acceptable.  "You should have seen my nade moron" is not.  A positive atmosphere will keep people confident and having fun and we will do people overall.<p>
All members are expected to know what they are doing and to be able to hold their own.  Other members will obviously back you up, but we won't be saying things like "you better get that hill" or "I hope you can kill him", we assume you will be doing your job and knowing what is the best action at the current time.  If you make a mistake no big deal.  We will say nice try and you come right back and help out.  Other members will fill in and pick up the slack where you messed up.  We don't expect everyone to be perfect all the time.<p>
All this being said keep mind that you are still expected to have your "game face" on when we enter a match and to play your best.  Just remember to be calm and have fun.<p>

All classes and styles of play are welcome.  As long as you are good at what you do we can find a place for you!
